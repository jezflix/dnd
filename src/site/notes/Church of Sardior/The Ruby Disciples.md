The Ruby Disciples is the official name for members of the Church of [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Sardior\|Sardior]].

The church is multi-planar and multi-versal with a presence on most known planes however the the size of that presence can range from full blown armies to just a single worshipper.

Considered a cult in most places, the church's history dates back further than most being formed originally on the primeval first world. In fact, the church was founded before some of the current pantheon of gods even existed. Knowledge of Sardior and his followers was mostly erased from history upon his destruction and his divine domains taken up by others.

### Tenets & Goals

Gem dragons revere Sardior is the ideal form of themselves. Sardior always sought knowledge, for the more you know, the better off you will be. This motto is one which the chosen of Sardior live by. In return, Sardior granted them the ability to discover and experience wondrous new psionic powers. These powers are a closely guarded secret of the church and only the chosen are granted access to the libraries that contain the secrets of these powers.

Just learning for learning's sake is not what Sardior's ideal stresses. Gaining knowledge should not just be reading from books. The trick for Sardior was to get someone else to read the book, then tell him all about it. The church continues that function through their various projects, often finding themselves curators of libraries and museums, or spymasters running networks of informants. The thanes however tend to operate on far grander scales.

In the millennia since Sardior's destruction the primary function and goal of the church has been his resurrection. To quote the [[Church of Sardior/Lore/Elegy For The First World\|Elegy For The First World]]:

> _Breathe, dragons; sing of the First World,_  
> _scattered in infinite seedling realities._  
> _Sing of Bahamut and Tiamat,_  
> _watching its sundering, mourning their labor._  
> _Sing too of Sardior, sundered,_  
> _consciousness scattered in minuscule fragments._  
> _Breathe, dragons: you are inheritors,_  
> ruling the wreck of the First World’s destruction.

The Thanes believe the resurrection of Sardior would unite all Dragonkind under his rule joined by Bahamut and Tiamat and together they would take their rightful place of rulers of all existence. To that end they have spent their time not only gathering knowledge, but what they call 'echoes'; small fragments of Sardior's consciousness that they hope once they have enough of, will bring about his return. 

### Hierarchy

[[Church Hierarchy.canvas|Church Hierarchy]] Map

The hierarchy and command structure of the church is somewhat convoluted in that while Sardior is the nominal deity, until his resurrection the divine power is actually drawn from his five Thanes who provide it based on what they think he would do. Technically not gods themselves, they were infused with enough of his primordial power at the time of his destruction to fulfil their roles.

To complicate matters even more, the church itself is split into five factions, each ruled by a thane. Each faction has it's own structure, and it is not uncommon for members of those factions to come to blows during a disagreement. Generally when something like this occurs, the faction leadership will step in and resolve the matter peacefully. If the offence is more than that, a church council (a nominee from each faction) will sit in judgment on the matter, and if needed, refer it to the Thanes if they cannot resolve it themselves.

Most members of the church are dragons or from draconic bloodlines (Draconians, Dragonborn, Kobolds etc.) with gemstone dragons filling most of the upper echelons of the leadership. It is not uncommon to have the same faction leaders in place for centuries, and in some cases millennia. Every race is welcomed to the church, however those with psionic ability tend to advance quicker and further within the ranks. The only exception is Illithids - they are considered a sworn enemy of the church and are expected to be treated as such by all members who know of their race.


### Chapters & Factions

The church is split into multiple chapters and factions, each under the control of a thane and named after their personal gem colour. All of them have different internal hierarchies and structures as detailed below

#### The Lavender ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Aleithilithos\|Aleithilithos]])
Most worshipers of Sardior who favour talk rather than combat tend to favour [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Aleithilithos\|Aleithilithos]] as their thane. Made up mostly of Amethyst dragons and dragonkin, there is a faction of Dwarven miners known as [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Aleithians\|Aleithians]] who worship him too. Members of the Lavendar tend to ignore the never-ending war between good and evil, and rather focus on the wellbeing of others and the arts.

Those that do go adventuring tend to be Bards (college of lore or spirits), Druids (circle of stars), Rangers (drakewarden), and clerics (life, peace, or twilight domain, or [[Church of Sardior/Sub-Classes/Night Whisperer\|Night Whisperer]]).

#### The Sapphire Horde ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Charisma\|Charisma]])

The most martial of the factions, the horde is run like a military organization with Charisma as their general. Constantly in training and striving to rise through the ranks, these worshippers are disciplined and are the first line of defence should the thanes ever need to go to war. Often members are sent off on specific missions, usually on behalf of one of the other less martial factions and the ranks are generally made up of Sapphire dragons and dragonkin, draconians, and some small number of undead and constructs. Uniquely the horde have a group of Warforged known as [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/The Charming\|The Charming]] who act as Charisma's personal guard and special operations unit.

When not found in Charisma's Fortress, those out in the worlds are generally Paladins ([[Church of Sardior/Sub-Classes/Oath of Sardior Paladin\|Oath of Sardior Paladin]]), Monks ([[Church of Sardior/Sub-Classes/Way of the Fractured Dragon\|Way of the Fractured Dragon]]), Rogues (soulknife), Sorcerers (draconic bloodline), Fighters (Psi Warrior), and Clerics (tempest domain).

#### The Crystal Lattice ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Hrodel\|Hrodel]])

Knowledge seekers, librarians, and inventors make up the majority of the Crystal Lattice. Boasting the largest numbers of all the factions, it is also the least organized with very little structure in the terms of hierarchy. There is an upper echelon of leadership made up mostly of Crystal dragons and dragonkin, but its membership ranks include creatures from almost every known race including, much to the annoyance of the other thanes, an Illithid. Lattice members rarely join into combat directly, preferring to stay on the sidelines and provide knowledge and aid where they can, focussing their efforts on gathering knowledge and locating echoes of sardior.

Those not tending to one of the various temples can be found out in the worlds learning everything they can and reporting it back to Hrodel. They are usually made up of Clerics (knowledge domain or [[Church of Sardior/Sub-Classes/Night Whisperer\|Night Whisperer]]), Bards (college of lore), Rangers (drakewarden), and Wizards (order of scribes or school of divination).

#### The Emerald Network ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Smargad\|Smargad]])

Spies. No other word best describes the members of the Emerald Network. Spread across the multi-verse, this loosely connected group stick to the shadows and report back on the machinations of any potential threats or foes to the church. A majority of their time is spent watching the Obsidian Order even going as far as infiltrating it when required. There are no ranks to the order, although members generally work in pairs, the more experienced of the two training the other and reporting back to the Spymaster, Smargad's nominated head of the faction. Like the Crystal Lattice, membership includes most known races including a small group of Changelings who have sworn allegiance to Smargad and in return has taught them how to change their shape into that of a young emerald dragon.

Generally Rogues (mastermind or scout) or Rangers (gloomstalker), they tend to stick to the shadows and keep their allegiance to Smargad a secret. Sometimes [[Church of Sardior/Sub-Classes/Night Whisperer\|Night Whisperer]]'s are recruited from other chapters to aid in their missions.

#### The Pure ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Tithonnas\|Tithonnas]])

The only sect to reject all members other than Topaz dragons and dragonkin, the arrogantly (according to some in the other factions) named The Pure is barely a faction at all. While all members technically worship Sardior (and by extension Tithonnas), they tend to keep to themselves and avoid contact with others if at all possible. They do however form a conclave once a century to discus any matters that need resolving, which generally ends up with most attendees deciding that they should change the next meeting to every millennia. Tithonnas does keep a few clerics and paladins as servants, but they tend to stay near his lairs rather than mingle with the other chapters.

#### Obsidian Order ([[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Seradess\|Seradess]])

One chapter of Sardior does not follow his benign teachings: the Sect of Seradess otherwise known as the Obsidian Order. This group was founded the same time as the other separate factions of Sardior, but with the destruction of Seradess and expulsion of the obsidian dragons, this group has gone rogue. At first, the group consisted of clerics and psions, but it has been reduced to psions and psychic warriors due to the loss of empowerment to the clerics. Its original intent was to learn new processes of item creation and the manipulation of [[Church of Sardior/Lore/Dragonsight\|Dragonsight]], but since the "Leaving," their goal has changed. They seek the information and the power to steal the essence of Seradess away from Sardior and establish her as a new god.

The church of Sardior knows of their existence and refers to them as the Cult of Seradess. They also haven't put much effort into eradicating this group, since they don't consider the group a threat. They wonder what a handful of rebellious psions can do against the might of a god.

Up until recently, this opinion held true. While the sect maintained its beliefs and gathered information, they lacked the needed power to have any real effect. However, this changed recently when a member of the order was visiting a bazaar on the Astral Plane and a powerful psionic being contacted her: the three-headed dragon known as [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Blithenpaxantadravos\|Blithenpaxantadravos]], or Blithen. He holds the knowledge and power the group needs to achieve their goal, but he has other unknown plans. He does wish to bring back Seradess, but only after he uses the cult to steal the power of Sardior for himself.

While many psions and psychic warriors revere Sardior and his thanes, some are still angry over the destruction of Seradess. They believe the act was a mistake by Sardior and that it needs to be corrected. These individuals are eventually sought out and found by the sect and are invited to join after a series of trials to determine their true beliefs. Once accepted as a member, the psion's life becomes one of secrecy and intrigue as he tries to further the knowledge of the sect while avoiding the detection of the church of Sardior.


### Church Outposts

Temples to Sardior are rarer than even his clerics. The Ruby Dragon's temples dedicated to him tend to be located in high areas which allow clear views of the night sky and close to a community of some sort. Most gem dragons keep a ruby on a small pedestal in their lairs as a shrine to him. 

Almost all of the established churches of Sardior have been dedicated directly to him, but the newer ones have begun to choose one of his thanes as a focus. These temples still worship and receive their power from Sardior, but the particular thane acts as the messenger or conduit and is revered as well. About half the new churches have been created as centers of worship to Sardior, with the other half being evenly divided into temples of Aleithilithos, Charisma, Hrodel, Smargad, and Tithonnas. The thane temples are usually smaller in size, tend to attract psions of the appropriate discipline, and are usually found in smaller locales that would normally be overlooked as a source of new knowledge. Notable exceptions to this are the Aleithian temples of Aleithilithos and the churches of Sardior in major metropolitan centers. It is not uncommon to have one or two thane shrines in addition to the Sardiorian churches in these cities.

The Church does however, have some more permanent outposts detailed below:

###### The Ruby Palace (Abeir-Toril)
The largest of the organized churches and effectively its seat of power, The Ruby Palace is [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Sardior\|Sardior]]'s personal island that is currently occupied by the Thanes.

There is also a permanent garrison of The Sapphire Horde housed on the island, and members of The Lattice maintain the library, portal-way, and gardens. 

The island itself floats in space keeping orbit around the planet in a similar way to the moon. It is always found in the dark side of the planet, and unless a creature knew of it's existence, would likely never spot it. Even then, looking up from the planet at best you would be able to see is what seemed to be a small red star.

###### Guild of Mediators (Radiant Citadel - Ethereal)
The church maintains the Guild of Mediators in the Citadel, known for providing balanced and impartial judgement for any parties seeking it. Using this as their front, the church's members both gather information from all the realms linked to the citadel, and recruit those they think may benefit the church.

###### [[Church of Sardior/Locations/The Crystal Sphere\|The Crystal Sphere]] of Hrodel (Wildspace) 
Both acting as a secondary lair for [[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Hrodel\|Hrodel]] and as a public library, although that vastly undersells the knowledge it provides, the crystal sphere is a wonder of the multiverse. 

######  Charisma's Fortress (Abeir-Toril)
[[Church of Sardior/NPCS/Charisma\|Charisma]] built her vast underground fortress under the Tungoran Mountains. A complex and labyrinthine network of caves and passages, it has no natural passage to the outside world. The fortress is the main training and living quarters for the Ruby Knights both from her faction and those of the other thanes, and is a staging point should the church ever need to go to war. It can comfortably house and provide for 10,000 troops if required, and its portal room maintains links to various points around Toril as well as the Ruby Palace. At any given time it is home to at least one fully trained Ruby Knight garrison and up to three other garrisons in training.

###### Krynn
Completely hidden, the church here was founded by Dragons and Draconians who had become disillusioned with the constant dragon wars between the followers of Paladine (Bahumat) and Takhisis (Tiamat). After an initial backlash from almost everyone, the organization moved into secrecy and were eventually renamed the [[Church of Sardior/Lore/Inheritors of The First World\|Inheritors of The First World]] Sect.
